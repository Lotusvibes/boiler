# Boilerplate for React

### This repo contains a basic file set to quickly reproduce some styles in a simple configuration of header, body, and footer components.  The App component is class based so you can add state efficiently and get moving into creating and styling a new component with ease.  Sass is used and as such, the variables and mixins should allow a quick update to referencing elements. 

### The folders and files are set to operate with Linux-based systems, allowing immediate deployment to Heroku and pipelining with CI/CD.
